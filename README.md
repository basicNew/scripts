# Scripts
Some helpful scripts that it was about time to get them organized. To get things set up (assuming that you cloned this in `~/scripts`):

### Git
Edit your `~.gitconfig` to look like:
```
[user]
        email = <your_email>
        name = <your_name>
[include]
        path = ~/scripts/gitconfig
```
